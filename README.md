# simple-chat-app
Refined a chat application using Socket.io, allowing users to view online members and send messages using the Enter key. Improved the interface with CSS and introduced slash commands and emoji keyword replacements. Encountered some Git challenges but eventually ensured the code was successfully pushed to GitHub locally.
